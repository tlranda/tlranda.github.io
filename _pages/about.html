Thomas Randall is a Graduate Research Assistant at Clemson University in the School of Computing (Go Tigers! üêØ).

My research focuses on performance optimization and autotuning for High Performance Computing (HPC) workloads and applications, especially with GPUs!
I am working towards my PhD dissertation at Clemson and have published research with scientists at Argonne and Oak Ridge National Laboratories.
You can also regularly meet me in person at the SuperComputing conference -- for 2024 we will be in Atlanta, GA!
<br>

My long-term career aspirations are to work as a Computer Scientist in the DoE National Labs and to continue serving the community at SuperComputing and other prestigious conferences in the field.
